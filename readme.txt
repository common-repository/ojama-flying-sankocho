This plugin doesn't help with anything. This plugin shows desktop mascot that is the bird. The Japanese Paradise Flycatcher painted simply comes out and only disturbs the work.

== Description ==

The Japanese Paradise Flycatcher comes out flutteringly and follows about mouse cursor.

This bird takes over mouse cursor when you stop mouse movement.

If you click several times, The JPF will go away.

That's all. That’s annoying.

Sankocho (Japanese Paradise Flycatcher）is a bird that breeds in summer season in Japan. And Sankocho is very popular with bird-watchers.

That bird is very lovable, unique, and voice is also unique. It makes us have fun.

That bird's voice sounded like a "tuki, hii, hoshi, hoihoihoi".

"Tuki" in Japanese means moon in English. "Hii" in Japanese means sun. and "hoshi" means star.

The name of Sankocho made by two part of "sanko" and "cho". "Sanko" means three kinds of light. "Cho" means bird.

The name of Sankocho named from three kinds of light, moon, sun and star.

"Ojama" of this plugin's name in Japanese means to disturb in English.

I made this plugin because I love Sankocho, but this plugin doesn't help with anything.
